[Js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com) is a JavaScript coding competition for HTML5 Game Developers. The fun part of the compo is the file size limit set to 13 kilobytes. The competition starts at 13:00 CEST, every 13th of August and ends at 13:00 CEST, every 13th of September. The theme for 2014 was **“The Elements: Earth, Water, Air and Fire”**.

This is the source code of my game “SpellCast Away”, which ranked 44th in 129 entries (check the winners list [here](http://2014.js13kgames.com/#winners) ). Please don’t judge my javascript code, this was supposed to be prototype code, but I happened to had much less free time than I had imagined, and in order to respect the contest deadlines, I had no time to redo the code. I actually worked the whole last night without any sleep to make the deadline! Not to mention I had very little experience with javascript as well at the time :)

I hope you enjoy the game which can be played here:
